[Here is a link to the live final project]()


## Introduction
Snowefox is a company that designs and make kit for sports teams, I have heard from people that use them that they don't have an eccomerce website yet. Therefore with it being a local company I decided that I would base this project on them and after the project has been submitted approach them and show them what I could do to help them grow as a company.

# Testing
## Functionality Testing
I used Mozilla web developer tools and Chrome developer tools throughout the project for testing and solving problems with responsiveness and style issues.

## Compatibility Testing
The website was tested across multiple virtual mobile devices and browsers. I checked all supported devices in both web developer tools.

I tested on hardware devices such as: Apple Ipad 12 pro, Samsung S20 Ultra smart phone with Android 10 and used a Iphone 5 to compare the difference in size.

<!-- ## Code Validation
At the end of the project I used 2 websites to validate the code.
 * [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate CSS
 * [Nu Html Checker](https://validator.w3.org/) to test HTML
 All code passed with no errors or warnings.

# Deployment
## DEPLOYMENT

### Heroku Deployment

<!-- This project was developed using [GitPod](https://gitpod.io) and pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/) then was deployed using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) using the following steps below: -->

#### Connecting to Heroku

<!-- 1. Log in to Heroku and create a new app by clicking `New` and `Create New App` and giving it an original name and setting the region to closest to your location.
2. Navigate to `Heroku Resources` and add `Postgres` using the free plan.
3. Create a `requirements.txt` file using the command `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt` in the GitPod terminal.
4. Create a `Procfile` with the terminal command `web: gunicorn artinspired.wsgi:application` and at this point checking the Procfile to make sure there is no extra blank line as this can cause issues when deploying to Heroku.
5. Use the loaddata command to load the fixtures for both json files: `python3 manage.py loaddata categories` and `python3 manage.py loaddata products`.
6. If it returns error message: `django.db.utils.OperationalError: FATAL: role <somerandomletters> does not exist` run `unset PGHOSTADDR` in your terminal and run the commands in step 11 again.
7. From the CLI log in to Heroku using command `heroku login -i`.
8. Temporarily disable Collectstatic by running: `heroku:config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app <heroku-app-name>` So that Heroku won't try to collect static files when we deploy.
9. Add Heroku app name to `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in settings.py.
10. Commit changes to GitHub using `git add .`, `git commit -m <commit message>`, `git push`.
11. Then deploy to Heroku using `git push heroku main`.
12. If the git remote isn't initialised you may have to do that first by running `heroku git:remote -a <heroku-app-name>`
13. Create a superuser using command: `heroku run python3 manage.py createsuperuser` so that you can log in to admin as required.
14. From the Heroku dashboard click `Deploy` -> `Deployment Method` and select `GitHub`.
15. Search for your GitHub repo and connect then Enable Automatic Deploys.
16. Generate secret key. Strong secret keys can be obtained from [MiniWebTool](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/). This automatically generates a secret key 50 characters long with alphanumeric characters and symbols. 
17. Add secret key to GitPod variables and Heroku config vars.
18. Set up Amazon AWS S3 bucket using instructions [below](#amazon-aws)
19. In the dashboard click `Settings` -> `Reveal Config Vars`
20. Set [config vars](#config-vars) using advice below. -->
